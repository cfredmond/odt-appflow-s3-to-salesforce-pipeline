# AWS S3 and AppFlow Terraform Configuration

This Terraform script creates two AWS S3 buckets, sets up the necessary permissions for AWS AppFlow to interact with these buckets, and optionally defines a flow for transferring data between them. The configuration primarily focuses on enabling AppFlow to access both the source and destination buckets, with the necessary actions such as listing, getting, and putting objects.

## Resources

### 1. S3 Bucket: `example_source`
An S3 bucket named `example-source-asda234234324` is created to serve as the source bucket for AppFlow.

### 2. IAM Policy for Source Bucket: `example_source`
The policy grants AWS AppFlow permissions to:
- List the objects in the `example_source` bucket.
- Retrieve (`GetObject`) objects from the bucket.

### 3. S3 Bucket Policy: `example_source`
The generated IAM policy is attached to the source bucket to enforce permissions for AppFlow's access.

### 4. (Optional) S3 Bucket: `example_destination`
An S3 bucket named `example-destination-121213123123123` is intended to be the destination bucket for AppFlow.

### 5. (Optional) IAM Policy for Destination Bucket: `example_destination`
The policy grants AWS AppFlow permissions to:
- Put objects into the `example_destination` bucket.
- Manage multipart uploads.
- Modify access control lists (ACLs) on objects in the destination bucket.

### 6. (Optional) AppFlow Configuration: `example`
An optional AWS AppFlow flow definition that:
- Pulls data from the source bucket (`example_source`).
- Pushes the data into the destination bucket (`example_destination`).
- Configures basic mapping for a specific field from the source to the destination.
- Triggers the flow manually (`OnDemand`).

## Configuration Overview

The following elements are defined in the Terraform configuration:

### S3 Source Bucket Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_source" {
  bucket = "example-source-asda234234324"
}
```
This creates the `example_source` S3 bucket, which will be used as the source in AppFlow.

### IAM Policy for Source Bucket
```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "example_source" {
  statement {
    sid    = "AllowAppFlowSourceActions"
    effect = "Allow"
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["appflow.amazonaws.com"]
    }
    actions = ["s3:ListBucket"]
    resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::example-source-asda234234324"]
  }
  statement {
    sid    = "AllowAppFlowObjectActions"
    effect = "Allow"
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["appflow.amazonaws.com"]
    }
    actions = ["s3:GetObject"]
    resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::example-source-asda234234324/*"]
  }
}
```
This policy allows AppFlow to:
- List the contents of the source bucket.
- Get objects from the source bucket.

### S3 Bucket Policy Attachment
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example_source" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example_source.id
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.example_source.json
}
```
This attaches the generated IAM policy to the `example_source` bucket, allowing AppFlow access.

### Optional Destination Bucket and Policy
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_destination" {
  bucket = "example-destination-121213123123123"
}
```
This creates a second S3 bucket, `example_destination`, which serves as the destination for the AppFlow flow.

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "example_destination" {
  statement {
    sid    = "AllowAppFlowDestinationActions"
    effect = "Allow"
    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["appflow.amazonaws.com"]
    }
    actions = ["s3:PutObject", "s3:AbortMultipartUpload", "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts", "s3:GetBucketAcl", "s3:PutObjectAcl"]
    resources = [
      "arn:aws:s3:::example-destination-121213123123123",
      "arn:aws:s3:::example-destination-121213123123123/*"
    ]
  }
}
```
This policy gives AppFlow the necessary permissions to upload and manage objects in the destination bucket.

### Optional AppFlow Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_appflow_flow" "example" {
  name = "example"

  source_flow_config {
    connector_type = "S3"
    source_connector_properties {
      s3 {
        bucket_name   = aws_s3_bucket_policy.example_source.bucket
        bucket_prefix = "example"
      }
    }
  }

  destination_flow_config {
    connector_type = "S3"
    destination_connector_properties {
      s3 {
        bucket_name = aws_s3_bucket_policy.example_destination.bucket

        s3_output_format_config {
          prefix_config {
            prefix_type = "PATH"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  task {
    source_fields     = ["exampleField"]
    destination_field = "exampleField"
    task_type         = "Map"

    connector_operator {
      s3 = "NO_OP"
    }
  }

  trigger_config {
    trigger_type = "OnDemand"
  }
}
```
This section defines an AppFlow flow that:
- Pulls data from the `example_source` bucket.
- Sends the data to the `example_destination` bucket.
- Maps a single field (`exampleField`).
- Is triggered manually.

## Usage

1. Modify the bucket names and policy details to suit your use case.
2. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## Optional AppFlow Configuration

To enable the AppFlow flow, uncomment the relevant sections in the Terraform script. These sections are currently commented out for those who only need the bucket and policy setup.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex field mappings to the AppFlow configuration.
- Set up automatic triggers for AppFlow based on schedule or event-driven mechanisms.
